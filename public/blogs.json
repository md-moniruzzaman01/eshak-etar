Sometimes it is inconvenient for certain types of props that are required by many components in the React application.

But let’s start off with the essential inline.This one displays the element inline or on the same line. In other words, inline elements do NOT start on a new line and only takes up as much width as its content. So, if you try to set any width and height, it will have NO effects."
